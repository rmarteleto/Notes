2. Tips for Culture and Values
   1. Don't pick the values out of thin air. Pick them by identifying the people already at your company that are hugely valuable, and identify the 4-6 things that make them great.
   2. Interview for those values, and when making an offer, talk about how you chose them because they embody those values and they will be part of the job expectations.
   3. Make them part of the job expectations. If people don't demonstrate the values, put them on PIPs.

   5. Themes:
      1. Constant Reinforcement: make our values ubiquitous, repeating them consistently in various contexts.
      2. Performance Alignment: use these values as a framework to evaluate individual and team performance.
      3. Practical Application: provide concrete examples to reinforce how these values translate into daily work.
      4. Positive Reinforcement: recognize and reward behaviors that embody our values.
      5. Cultural Integration: embed these values into our everyday conversations, decision-making, and problem-solving.
      6. Leadership by Example: Leaders must walk the walk.
      7. Onboarding and Review: integrate our values into the onboarding process and incorporate them into regular check-ins, team meetings, and performance reviews.
      8. Value-Aligned Hiring: interview for our values, and when making an offer, talk about how we chose them because they embody those values and they will be part of the job expectations
      9. Values are Emergent: the "lived" values arise from actions of the group and need to be discovered/guided rather than pushed from the top. A leader's purview is to steer and champion the ones that lead to good outcomes through hiring, promotion, recognition, and repetition
      10. Values are in Tension: values help guide choices you make as an org so it's worth being explicit about the choices and tradeoffs being made. Very few people love sloppy work but it may arise if the team/company values velocity above all else

  2.  It’s not what you say, it’s how you live. You do need to be consistent and repeat and reinforce your team values, but it’s always better when it comes in the context of a practical example. If you read the value statement at the beginning of every meeting, you’re just training your team to zone out for the first five minutes until you change the slide. But if you make it real and part of everyday life, then it sinks in. Then it goes from “this is what we value” to “this is how we work together.”
